    <h1>DevOps model</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>The DevOps methodology is the newcomer to the SDLC scene. it emerged from two trends: the application of Agile and Lean practices to operations work and the general shift in business toward seeing the value of collaboration between development and operations staff at all stages of the SDLC process.</h4>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
   <h4>In a DevOps model, Developers and Operations teams work together closely and sometimes as one team to accelerate innovation and the deployment of higher-quality and more reliable software products and functionalities. Updates to products are small but frequent. Discipline, continuous feedback and process improvement, and automation of manual development processes are all hallmarks of the DevOps model.</h4>
