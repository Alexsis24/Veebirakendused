    <h1>Big Bang model</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>The Big Band model is one of the most basic models which is implemented by the newcomers and the students as it is fairly easy to implement. This is because no prior planning for the project life cycle needs to be done which can however lead to certain risks.</h4>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
   <h4>For this, one can just start production of the project with capital and human resources. There is a much greater probability that the final product might not be in accordance to the requirements specified by the. This can drop the reputation of the organization among the clients. However, the requirements can easily be added into the project once it gets started and even while it is near completion and that too without much of analysis.</h4>
    <h2>When to use it?</h2>
    <h4>This model is best suited for relatively smaller projects which are not supposed to be used by larger organizations or for significant purposes. It is primarily used for academic purposes where timeline and budget are not specified and are solely being developed for practice purposes.</h4>

    <tr>
        <td>It is a fairly simple model which makes it relatively easy to manage. Thus it does not drain out too much energy from the team.</td>
        <td>The model is not suitable for large projects by any means as it would not provide any sought of support that is required in such projects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Being a simple model, there is a requirement of less resources.</td>
        <td>As the requirements are not determined at the initial stages, there can be greater chances that the requirements might be misunderstood. This gap can lead to greater financial and time losses.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As it is easy to implement, it is the prime choice for the majority of students. Mostly, it is because of its as easy implementation as an SDLC model.</td>
        <td>This model is not at all suitable for object-oriented projects and otherwise complex projects. It is because such projects require fairly sought-after techniques and experienced staff members.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It gives a lot of flexibility to the developers, so that they can make certain changes which allows them to be innovative and do not make them stick to given guidelines only.</td>
        <td>It is also not suitable for ongoing projects, as it can be the reason for scraping of the project.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>For the implementation of this model, a team does not need to plan the whole lifecycle prior to the beginning of the project.</td>
