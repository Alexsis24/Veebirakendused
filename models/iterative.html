    <h1>Iterative</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <h4>The Iterative SDLC model does not need the full list of requirements before the project starts. The development process may start with the requirements to the functional part, which can be expanded later. The process is repetitive, allowing to make new versions of the product for every cycle.</h4>
    <h2>Use cases for Iterative model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The requirements to the final product are strictly predefined
            Applied to the large-scale projects
            The main task is predefined, but the details may advance with the time
        </li>
    </ul>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Some functions can be quickly developed at the beginning of the development lifecycle.</td>
        <td>Iterative model requires more resources than the waterfall model.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The paralleled development can be applied.</td>
        <td>Constant management is required. Issues with architecture or design may occur because not all the requirements are foreseen during the short planning stage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The progress is easily measurable. The shorter iteration is - the easier testing and debugging stages are.</td>
        <td>Bad choice for the small projects. The process is difficult to manage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It is easier to control the risks as high-risk tasks are completed first.</td>
        <td>The risks may not be completely determined even at the final stage of the project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Problems and risks defined within one iteration can be prevented in the next sprints.</td>
        <td>Risks analysis requires involvement of the highly-qualified specialists.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flexibility and readiness to the changes in the requirements.</td>
