    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>Waterfall â€“ is a cascade SDLC model, in which development process looks like the flow, moving step by step through the phases of analysis, projecting, realization, testing, implementation, and support. This SDLC model includes gradual execution of every stage completely. This process is strictly documented and predefined with features expected to every phase of this software development life cycle model.</h4>
    <h2>Use causes for the Waterfall model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The requirements are precisely documented.
            Product definition is stable.
            The technologies stack is predefined which makes it not dynamic.
            No ambiguous requirements.
            The project is short.
