    <h1>RAD Model</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>RAD is the acronym used for Rapid Application Development which is a software developing methodology based on iterative and prototyping. This model does not require any peculiar and extensive planning before starting out due to its use for short duration projects.</h4>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <h4>It focuses on garnering requirements from the customer so that prototypes can be developed and used in repetitive iterations for an effective delivery of the project. The teams which are used for this methodology are highly skilled yet small. Additionally, they ensure that the prototypes which are developed for the project can be reused.</h4>

        <th>Disadvantages</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As the methodology lays emphasis majorly on evolution of the product rather than developing it from scratch. This results in reducing the development time of the final product by a considerable margin.</td>
        <td>It is primarily suitable for the projects which are to be completed in a shorter period of time. Thus the projects must have considerably smaller development times in order to appropriately deliver results under RAD.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As the name suggests, Rapid Application Development (RAD), the changes are welcome and easily accommodated without making much impact on the predefined timelines.</td>
        <td>It has a high dependency on the user involvement which it requires for the majority of the life cycle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This model allows to measure the progress of the project easily and effectively.</td>
        <td>The model being dynamic, requires highly skilled designers and developers to carry out the designated tasks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>There are several RAD tools available in the market, which can be used to relatively shorten the iteration time.</td>
        <td>It is only suitable for projects which have a generous budget and it cannot be implemented in low-budgeted projects. This is because the automated code and modelling are expensive tasks. The fundamental necessity for any project is the requirement gathering, for which a technically strong team needs to be employed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The model introduces the integration of modules at very initial stages, thus mitigating any issues at a smaller level. Also, there are a lot less chances of major issues arising at the time of final integrations.</td>
        <td>With the experienced designers, the model depends highly on generous modelling skills.</td>
