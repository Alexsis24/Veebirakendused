    <h2>Overview of the Scrum Framework</h2>
    <h4>Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The product owner creates a product backlog (essentially, a wishlist of tasks that need to be prioritized in a project)</li>
        <li>The stakeholders and the product owner conduct a review at the end of each sprint</li>
        <li>The Scrum team conducts a sprint planning session where the tasks necessary to complete items on the wishlist is broken down into small, more easily manageable chunks</li>
        <li>The team creates a sprint backlog and plans its implementation</li>
        <li>The team decides a time duration for every sprint (the most common intervals is probably two weeks)</li>
        <li> The team gets together every day for a brief Scrum meeting (often referred to as a Daily Standup) where each member of the team shares daily updates, helping the team and the project manager assess the progress of the project</li>
        <li>The certified Scrum Master guides the team and keeps them focused and motivated</li>
        <li>The stakeholders and the product owner conduct a review at the end of each sprint</li>
    </ul>
