    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>V-shaped SDLC model is an expansion of classic waterfall model and it’s based on associated test stage for the every development stage. This is a very strict model and the next stage is started only after the previous phase.</h4>
    <h2>Use causes for the v-shaped model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
        For the projects where an accurate product testing is required
        For the small and mid-sized projects, where requirements are strictly predefined
        The engineers of the required qualification, especially testers, are within easy reach.
        </li>
    </ul>
