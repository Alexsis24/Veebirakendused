            <td>&#187; Kanban system advocates continuous and sustainable improvements in the production systems of the company. Kanban not only consist of manual guidelines or cards but also visualizations of the process outputs which makes the review of work easier.   &#641;&#641;</td>
            <td>&#187; Kanban is not suitable for the environments that are dynamic in nature. Because a kanban system assumes the plans that are stable and consistent to a certain extent, it may become ineffective in industries where the activities are not static.   &#641;&#641;</td>

        <tr>
            <td>&#187; Kanban system is a very responsive system and does not promote any lags or delays. As the tasks are continuously shifted between the columns of the kanban cards, it automatically highlights the areas where any limiting factors are raised that could hold up the overall output which can be responded to as soon as possible by shifting and switching the resources from the other tasks.   &#641;&#641;</td>
            <td>&#187; Kanban will become very difficult to apply if too much activities or tasks are interrelated in a system. This is because such systems enhance the possibility of transfers of goods and expertise amongst different tasks too often and increases difficulty to keep the pace of all these activities.   &#641;&#641;</td>
