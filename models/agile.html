    <h1>Agile model</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <h4>In the agile methodology after every development iteration, the customer is able to see the result and understand if he is satisfied with it or he is not. This is one of the advantages of the agile software development life cycle model. One of its disadvantages is that with the absence of defined requirements it is difficult to estimate the resources and development cost. Extreme programming is one of the practical use of the agile model. The basis of such model consists of short weekly meetings â€“ Sprints which are the part of the Scrum approach.</h4>
    <h2>Use causes for the Agile model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The users needs change dynamically.
            Less price for the changes implemented because of the many iterations.
            Unlike the Waterfall model, it requires only initial planning to start the project.
